Components are basic building blocks of applications

Created Auth modules [functions that belong to the same funcitonality]
    - new-user
    - login
    - reset pw
    - 

Components is the smallest functionality that we will implement in our application.

When we group multiple components-> becomes a module

Parent-child relationship of components:

Tree-herirachy of components
    Dashboard page
        display_contact_list [one component]
            contact-grid   [component]
                contact-imports 
                contact-export
            contact-options

Lets create some custom components.

cd src\app\contacts\
ng g component add-contact
ng g component edit-contact
ng g component list-contacts
ng g component delete-contacts

all componenets have 4 files
    - component.ts -> Class File [Methods & Logic]
    - component.html -> View [UI]
    - components.spec.ts -> Unit test script for componenet
    - component.scss -> Stylesheet of the component
 
Component Decorator inside the component.ts file
@Component

    Selector -> Unique id of this componenet:
        - Selector-> "app-<name_of_component>"
        - "app" prefix can be changed in "src\angular.json"

    Templates in componenet:
        templateUrl 
            -link-> html code: component/html
            - is always one file

        ||

        template
            enclose html code within this field using `<h1>Some Headlines</h1>`
            instead of html file

    styleUrls -> link to ur stylesheet : component.scss
        -> is an array
        -> it can take more than one stylesheet as input
